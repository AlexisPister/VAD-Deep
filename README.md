# VAD-Deep
Voice Activity Detection (VAD) system with Deep Learning

## How it works
The system use a deep neural network implemented with Pytorch which classify the frames of an audio sample as 'speech' or 'non speech'. The model reach 90% of accuracy with voice samples with no or little noises

## Discussion
I did this project for an internship interview. You can ask for the code if you are curious.

It was my first approach to voice activity detection with deep learning and it was really fun.
Here are some things I would do to improve the project after some reflexion and my machine learning classes :

* Computing of the precision and recall of the model
* Study of ROC curves
* Use of the context of the frames to improve classification
